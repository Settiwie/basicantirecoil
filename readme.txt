Hi, I always wanted to make a anti recoil script. This is a very simple take based on a anti recoil script made by KripTAEP.
His version used monitor capturing to predict a recoil pattern, but it didnt work for me. 
So I took a look at his code and used the base of it to create this application.
It has a profile system. The keybinds should be displayed in the application window and in the config file.

!Dont sell this (No I dont think its worth selling), a part of it is probably licensed to KrypTAEK!
